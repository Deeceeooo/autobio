          I am 20 years young, residing at Rizal, Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. I Graduated as a STEM student from Tagudin National High School. Without any plan in my mind, I ended up attending ISPSC - Tagudin Campus for college, and I am currently taking up BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) as my chosen program. I chose IT not because I was left no choice, but it was the safe path for me. Considering how fast technology evolves, and how people are starting to be awfully reliant on technology—specifically on the internet—I thought that having an IT diploma would be a good armor I could use in the future.

          Other things that I do when I am not sticking my nose on the screen of my laptop are: doing my obligations in our barangay, riding my bike, experimenting on whatever food or edible things we have in the fridge, and sleeping.
